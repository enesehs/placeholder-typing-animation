# Placeholder Typing Animation

Placeholder Typing Animation is a JavaScript code snippet that creates a realistic typing animation effect for an input element's placeholder. The animation simulates the process of typing and deleting different texts, providing an engaging user experience.

## How it Works

1. The code defines an array named `texts` that contains the list of texts to be displayed in the input's placeholder.

2. Variables `currentTextIndex`, `currentText`, and `currentCharIndex` are initialized to keep track of the current text being displayed and the current character index.

3. The `inputElement` variable stores the reference to the input element in the HTML.

4. The animation is controlled by three boolean variables: `isTyping`, `isDeleting`, and `isAnimationRunning`.

5. The `animateText()` function handles the typing and deleting animation. It uses `setTimeout()` to control the animation speed.

6. When typing, the function extracts the substring of `currentText` up to the `currentCharIndex` and updates the input's placeholder accordingly. It also adds a blinking cursor "|" to create the typing effect.

7. When the text is fully typed, the animation switches to the deleting mode, removing characters one by one until the entire text is deleted.

8. After a delay of 2 seconds, the animation switches back to typing mode with the next text in the `texts` array.

9. The `blinkCursor()` function manages the blinking cursor effect by adding and removing the "|" character from the input's placeholder.

10. The `startTypingAnimation()` function initiates the animation loop if it's not already running.

11. The `stopTypingAnimation()` function stops the animation.

12. The `resetTextAnimation()` function resets the animation to its initial state, useful when you want to restart the animation from the beginning.

## How to Use

1. Include the JavaScript code in your HTML file or link to an external JS file.

2. Ensure the input element has an `id="username"` attribute. You can change this ID to match your input element if needed.

3. Call `startTypingAnimation()` to start the animation when the page loads or when you want to begin the animation.
